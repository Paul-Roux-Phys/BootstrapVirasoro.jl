# Solving bootstrap equations

The package provides functionality to create and solve linear systems of bootstrap equations.

## Examples

An example notebook solving crossing symmetry for a few four-point functions in loop models
can be found [here](https://github.com/Paul-Roux-Phys/BootstrapVirasoro.jl/blob/main/examples/On4pt.ipynb)

### Generalised minimal model

```julia
using BootstrapVirasoro

c = CC
```
